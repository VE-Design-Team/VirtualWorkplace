					<p>Throughout your shift, you monitored Dot’s food intake. Read the following information carefully
						as you will have to input this information on the next page into the 'Food and fluids' record.
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul class="pl-5">
							<li> 8:00 Breakfast - Two slices of toast and a glass of juice which she was able to eat and
								drink
								completely, this took her about 15 minutes. </li>
							<li>
								9:00 After breakfast - She felt a little unwell and did not drink any of her tea. </li>
							<li>
								10:30 Morning tea - She was able to drink a whole glass of water (100ml) by taking
								several sips over 10 minutes. </li>
							<li>
								12:00 Lunch - She took 20 minutes but could only eat half of her sandwich and half a cup
								of coffee (125ml). </li>

						</ul>

					<p>

						On the next page you will find the 'Food and fluids' record.</p>
					<p>The details from the previous two days when the 'Food and fluids' record began are already in
						place in the form. You can use this information as a guide to assist you with the details
						you need to record.</p>
					<p>
						It is important this document is accurate as it could be used by medical staff to highlight a
						health issue.</p>
					<p>
						All the blank spaces need to be filled; some will need a text input and others will have a
						drop-down menu which can be accessed by selecting the small black triangle on the right-hand
						side of the blank space.</p>
					<p>
						Once you have familiarised yourself with the date, times, food and fluid items, and the amounts
						taken, select the Next button to continue.
